## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a student at Epitech, enrolled in the PGE (Grande École Program), which has allowed me to explore all aspects of the development world.

So far, I've had the opportunity to dive into web development, DevOps, artificial intelligence, system administration, and cybersecurity.

Among all these fields, I discovered a real passion for **DevOps** and **AI** — combining automation, infrastructure, and smart solutions is where I feel most at home.
